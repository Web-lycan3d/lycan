Lycan 3D offers printed parts which are cheaper and as a result production time in-house is shorter and this means reductions in production costs, especially when dealing with the manufacturing of complex bodies. 3D prototyping can also significantly reduce turnaround times across all stages of manufacturing allowing more agility. Unlike traditional approaches to vehicle design where a variety of materials are used, 3D printing in automotive design allows lower consumption of materials and wastage which is beneficial for all stages of manufacturing. 3D printing also allows for more efficient car model design, prototyping, testing and production using industrial 3D printing software. This software enables designers to create printable designs which are the first crucial step in creating 3D printed automobile parts, and the core of the printing process.`,
