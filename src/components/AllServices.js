      "MJF an acronym for Multi Jet Fusion is a powder based additive manufacturing process transforming the manufacturing sector through its versatility , speed and manufacturing. The manufacturing of parts begins by the recoated blade spreading the polymer powder of a predetermined height on to the build plate and perpendicular to the re-coater movement a print head selectively applies fusing and detailing agents followed by the exposure of the area to high intensity infrared heating lamps which enable solidification of the areas where the binding and detailing agents are applied. The process is continued layer by layer until the final layer of the build chamber. The MJF technology is widely loved by the industry for its isotropic, airtight and watertight functional parts suitable not just for prototyping but also for end use applications.",

Up to 4 different materials, colours or a combination of them can be printed simultaneously to produce vivid & realistic models. Printing is done using materials such as ceramics and gypsum. The builds are among the fastest of current technologies, but have a poor surface finish and require post-processing. The brittle nature of the final build makes this technology less suitable for commercial applications. But the ability to produce parts from unique materials at low cost and high speed makes it ideal for artists, architects, product designers and makers from all fields.",

The binder can also incorporate dyes (for colour printing), and additives for enhanced component properties such as viscosity, surface tension, and boiling point. In Binder Jetting, the materials such as metals, sand, and ceramics which are used for production need to be in fine granular form. It is a high speed 3D Printing process which provides components of high dimensional accuracy, and can be used to create multi-material parts or components in full colour using sandstone or PMMA powder. Because of its high-speeds and material flexibility, binder jetting is used for production of large sand casting patterns, affordable metal 3D printing, and as an alternative to traditional high-volume manufacturing processes. The opportunity to use unique materials in builds also appeals to  Makers  like artists, architects, and product designers.",

      "Injection Moulding is a manufacturing process for producing parts by injecting molten material into a mould made of metal, usually an alloy of steel or aluminium. In relation to 3D printing, latest advances have made it possible to produce these moulds from certain photopolymers which do not melt when injected with some lower temperature thermoplastics. Metallic moulds require heavy investment and long lead times, since the precision tooling of metals to accurately match the product requirements needs intensive work. On the other hand, photopolymer moulds are easier and quicker to produce albeit with limited complexity and range of materials.This process is best suited for production of parts of any size with uniform quality on a large scale. However it is important to get the design right before tooling, since any changes to a finished mould can be costly and time consuming. To keep the build cost per unit low, it is necessary that a large number of parts (100s or 1000s) are cast on each occasion.",

      "Vacuum Casting is a â€˜copyingâ€™ process whereby a unit of the component to be produced is used to create a mold from silicone or 2-component polyurethanes. This mold is then made into 2 halves and used to create multiple copies of the component within a short period of time using a vacuum chamber. Apart from the ability to mass produce components, the primary reasons for choosing this technique are to avoid entrapment of air within the part and producing high-quality builds for end-use.Although there is overhead investment involved for the mold and equipment, this process is much more efficient than the comparable injection moulding process. However the number of components that can be cast before the mould wears out are comparatively fewer, and hence Vacuum Casting is best suited for production in medium volumes.",
